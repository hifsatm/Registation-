This code is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is named "Registration" and it provides a mechanism for registering different entities such as banks, data owners, and data requestors.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Pragma Statement: pragma solidity 0.6.0; specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used.

2. Contract Definition: contract Registration { ... } defines the smart contract named "Registration".

3. State Variables: The contract declares several state variables using mapping and address data types to store information about different entities. The variables include:

	mapping(address => bool) Bank: Tracks registered banks.
	mapping(address => bool) DataOwner: Tracks registered data owners.
	mapping(address => bool) DataRequestor: Tracks registered data requestors.
	mapping(address => uint) Bank_LIC: Stores the license numbers of registered banks.
	mapping(address => uint) DataOwner_LIC: Stores the license numbers of registered data owners.
	mapping(address => uint) DataRequestor_LIC: Stores the license numbers of registered data 	requestors.

4. address owner: Stores the address of the contract owner.
Modifier: The contract defines a modifier onlyOwner which restricts certain functions to be callable only by the contract owner. The modifier checks if the caller (msg.sender) is the same as the contract owner's address.

5. Constructor: The contract has a constructor function that is executed once during contract deployment. It initializes the contract owner with the address of the deployer.

6. Registration Functions: The contract provides three registration functions:

7. register_Bank: Allows the contract owner to register a bank by specifying its address and license number.

8. register_DataOwner: Allows the contract owner to register a data owner by specifying its address and license number.

9. register_DataRequestor: Allows the contract owner to register a data requestor by specifying its address and license number.

These functions update the respective mappings and check for duplicate registrations or invalid license numbers.

10. Query Functions: The contract includes several functions to query the state of the contract:

11. isOwner: Checks if the provided address is the owner of the contract.

12. BankExists: Checks if the provided address corresponds to a registered bank.

13. DataOwnerExists: Checks if the provided address corresponds to a registered data owner.

14. DataRequestorExists: Checks if the provided address corresponds to a registered data requestor.

15. BanklicenceisValid: Checks if the license number for a given bank address is valid (not equal to 0 or 777).

16. DataOwnerlicenceisValid: Checks if the license number for a given data owner address is valid.

17. DataRequestorlicenceisValid: Checks if the license number for a given data requestor address is valid.

These functions allow querying the contract to determine the registration status and license validity for different entities.
